# Repair-Request
<b>Repair-Request</b> is a service portal that allows tenants to request maintenance services and provide feedback anytime, day or night.


This tool aims to streamline the process, providing an efficient, user-friendly interface for tenants and a manageable system for our maintenance team. By centralizing all repair requests in one place, we can:

1. **Improve Response Time**: Immediate notification to the maintenance team ensures quicker response and resolution of issues, enhancing tenant satisfaction.
2. **Organize Requests**: Each request is logged and tracked, allowing for better management and prioritization based on urgency and availability of resources.
3. **Increase Transparency**: Tenants can be kept informed about the status of their requests, reducing follow-up calls and enhancing trust.
4. **Data Insights**: Accumulated data can be analyzed to identify recurring issues, plan preventive maintenance, and allocate resources more effectively.
5. **24/7 Accessibility**: Tenants can submit requests at their convenience, ensuring that no issues are missed due to office hours constraints.
